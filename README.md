Python Script to Explore US Bikeshare Data
-------------------------------------------
This Python script is written for Project 3 of  Udacity Programming for Data Scienc and is used to explore data related to bike share systems for Chicago, New York City, and Washington. It imports data from csv files and compute descriptive statistics from the data. It also takes in users' raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.


Steps to execute the script
----------------------------
You can run the script using a Python integrated development environment (IDE) such as Spyder. To install Spyder, you will need to download the Anaconda installer. This script is written in Python 3, so you will need the Python 3.x version of the installer. After downloading and installing Anaconda, you will find the Spyder IDE by opening Anaconda Navigator.


Input / Upstream Datasets
--------------------------
The datasets used for this script contain bike share data and can't be uploaded here due to size limitation. The data is provided by Motivate, which is a bike share system provider for many cities in the United States. The data files for all three cities contain the same six columns:
Start Time, End Time,Trip Duration (in seconds), Start Station, End Station, User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also contain the following two columns:
Gender, Birth Year

Question and Scenario's in scope of this script 
-----------------------------------------------

Q1: What is the most popular month for start time?
Q2: What is the most popular day of week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) for start time?
Q3: What is the most popular hour of day for start time?
Q4: What is the total trip duration and average trip duration?
Q5: What is the most popular start station and most popular end station?
Q6: What is the most popular trip?
Q7: What are the counts of each user type?
Q8: What are the counts of gender?
Q9: What are the earliest (i.e. oldest person), most recent (i.e. youngest person), and most popular birth years?
